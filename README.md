# Trading-with-Momentum

This is my first project on the AI for Trading Nanodegree. 
In this project, I created a Momentum Trading strategy and used a statistical test to conclude whether or not there is Alpha in the signal.

This project gives an overview of the quant workflow by preprocessing data with Pandas, implementing a trading signal and evaluating the performance of the signal.
