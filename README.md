# Trading-with-Momentum

This is my first project on the AI for Trading Nanodegree. 

- In this project, I computed a signal for a given time range and applied it to the dataset to produce projected returns. 
- I created a Momentum Trading strategy and used a statistical test on the mean of the returns to conclude whether or not there is Alpha in the signal.

This project gives an overview of the quant workflow by preprocessing data with Pandas, implementing a trading signal and evaluating the performance of the signal.
